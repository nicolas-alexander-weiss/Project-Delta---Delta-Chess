Student research project examining the possibilities of AI in chess and its efficient implementation on consumer hardware.

After starting off successfully during Winter Quarter 2018 at Foothill College (Los Altos Hills, CA), Delta Chess will undergo a great refactoring yielding higher modularity, efficiency and game strength.
